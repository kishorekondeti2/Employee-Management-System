----
git clone https://github.com/kishorekondeti2/employee-management-system.git
cd employee-management-system


2.Backend Setup (Spring Boot)
Open the project in your preferred IDE (Eclipse/IntelliJ)
Configure your application.properties file:

spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/ems
spring.datasource.username=root
spring.datasource.password=yourpassword
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update

Run the application using:
mvn spring-boot:run

3. Frontend Setup

Sample API Endpoints
These endpoints are exposed by the Spring Boot REST controller:

Get Employee by ID: GET /api/employees/{id}

Add Employee: POST /api/employees

Update Employee: PUT /api/employees/{id}

Delete Employee: DELETE /api/employees/{id}

You can test these APIs using Postman, curl, or your frontend.
